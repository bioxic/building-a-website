        There are a couple of ways we can set colors. I set an inline style here. Perhaps it's not the best solution though.
        If I want all the paragraphs to be the same color, I will have to make sure to add the same styling to every p tag.
        That can get annoying and messy really quickly.
        <br>
        To combat that, we have what's called the <code>style</code> tag:
         </p>
         <code>
             ```
             <style>
             p {
                color:#637373
             }
             </style>
             ```
         </code>
    <p>
        Your webpage can have any colors you want. You can find a list of colors to try out here:
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp</a>.
        If you want to have more fun with colors, you can use a color picker to generate the hex code for any RGB value.
        <br>
        Every tag has it's own use. We'll get to know a number of tags as we work on making a really cool website.
